.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.RS

.nf
ssrt [\-\-pause|\-p] [\-\-delay|\-d SECONDS] [\-\-select|\-s] [\-\-config\-dir|\-c DIR] [\-\-input\-file|\-i FILE]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
In my global keybinding configuration (\fBi3wm\fP)
i have the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
bindsym Mod4+Print exec \-\-no\-startup\-id ssrt
bindsym Mod1+Print exec \-\-no\-startup\-id ssrt \-\-pause

.fi
.RE

.PP
So by just pressing
Super+PrScrn i can start and
stop a screenrecording. The second keybinding uses
Alt as the modifier and toggle
play/pause (\fIit will also start a recording if
there is none. And the first keybinding will
resume a paused recording\fP). \fBssrt\fP also
executes commands on different events, namely:
.br
\- delay

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
start
.IP \(bu 2
stop
.IP \(bu 2
pause
.IP \(bu 2
resume

.RE

.PP
With this functionality one could do all kinds of
actions depending on the events, some examples:
.br
\- unmute the microphone before recording starts

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
preview the recording in a videoplayer when recording stops
.IP \(bu 2
convert recorded media
.IP \(bu 2
display notifications on pause and delay

.RE

.PP
I added it as an external "plugin" like system
like this because the needs, options and
applications different users might want to use are
probably more then the number of users.

.PP
It looks for events in \fBSSR\_CONFIG\_DIR\fP/events
, where executable files with the same name as the
event can be placed. When \fBssrt\fP is launched for
the first time a sample \fB\fCevents\fR directory will be
created but the are "empty". See
[./event\-examples] to see a complete setup.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-\-pause\fR|\fB\fC\-p\fR
.br
Toggle play/pause of an ongoing recording or
start a new recording if there is none.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-delay\fR|\fB\fC\-d\fR SECONDS
.br
Adds a delay in SECONDS (sleep) before starting a
new recording. Has no effect when stopping a
recording or toggling play/pause. This will also
trigger the \fBdelay event\fP and pass SECONDS as
the first argument.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-select\fR|\fB\fC\-s\fR
.br
Execute \fB\fCslop(1)\fR before starting a recording for
selection of area to record. Without this option
the full active monitor will be recorded.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-config\-dir\fR|\fB\fC\-c\fR DIR
.br
Override the environment variable
\fBSSR\_CONFIG\_DIR\fP\&. Defaults to \fB\fC\~/.ssr\fR . This
will be the directory where the statsfile,
configfile and \fBevents directory\fP will be stored
and created.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-input\-file\fR|\fB\fC\-i\fR FILE
.br
Override the environment variable
\fBSSRT\_INPUT\_FILE\fP\&. Defaults to \fB\fC/tmp/ssrt/in\fR .
Commands can be appended to this file while the
recording is running.
.br
\fB\fCecho record\-pause > /tmp/ssrt/in\fR . See
simplescreenrecorder man page or \fB\fC\-\-help\fR for list
of available commands.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-help\fR|\fB\fC\-h\fR
.br
Show help and exit.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-version\fR|\fB\fC\-v\fR
.br
Show version and exit.
